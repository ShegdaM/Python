A CHERRY ORCHARD BY THE HOUSE.
THE PLOWMEN PLOW THE FERTILE GROUND
IT’S EVENING MOTHER CALLS THEM HOME.
A FAMILY SUPS BY THE HOUSE.
A DAUGHTER SERVES THE EVENING MEAL.
BUT CAN’T. SHE BLAMES THE NIGHTINGALE.
IT’S GETTING DARK, AND BY THE HOUSE,
BESIDE THEM SHE TOO FELL ASLEEP.
AND NIGHTINGALE THEIR VIGIL KEEP.
